          <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>The AquaGrill teams’ passion for cooking was initially kindled in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 
              the establishment where they studied in a neighbourhood lying on the outskirts of Montreal.
              It is where they grew up, amid the hubbub of dishes, pots and pans and clients. The bar was 
              their living room, their playground, where they did their homework, watched television...
              whence the aroma of the stews generously, simply and honestly prepared by their master, wafted in.
            </p>
